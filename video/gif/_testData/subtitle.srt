1
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,550
I don't understand at all, maybe one day you can tell me

2
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,370
That everything I'm feeling is all

3
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,650
Protocol for a being like me, It's all healthy, don't you worry your tired head.

4
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,170
Lay down beside me, rest your eyes, please. We are all better off with rest.

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,630
All my life granted, all the sights I've seen

6
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,250
All the sounds I've heard

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,950
All the words I've learned, I know nothing on a grander scale.

8
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,810
If you still believe in me, then we can go.

9
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,350
What do you believe in

10
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,150
when it's all falling down around you now?

11
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:07,010
You don't have no choice.

12
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,430
Sometimes I don't understand.

13
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,490
Why I do the things that I do?

14
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,470
Sometimes I don't understand.

15
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,770
Why I do the things that I do?

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,150
Pen on paper seems so permanent, every line of.

17
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,090
Pen on paper seems so permanent, every line of.
